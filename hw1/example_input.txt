In the race between DNA sequencing throughput and computer speed, sequencing is winning by a mile. Sequencing throughput has recently been improving at a rate of about fivefold per year, whereas computer performance generally follows Mooreâ€™s Law doubling only every 18 or 24 months. As this gap widens, the question of how to design higher-throughput analysis pipelines becomes crucial. If analysis throughput does not turn the corner, research projects will continually stall until analyses catch up. How do we close the gap? One option is to invent algorithms that make better use of a fixed amount of computing power. Unfortunately, algorithmic breakthroughs of this kind, like scientific breakthroughs, are difficult to plan or foresee.
